    <h1>Shipping & Delivery Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Shipping & Delivery Policy applies to all purchases made through the
      <strong>Amoura</strong> application, operated by Trupasion. Since Amoura
      is a digital service, no physical goods are shipped. Instead, delivery
      refers to the activation of digital features within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      Amoura provides online matchmaking and premium subscription-based
      features. As such, there are no physical products to be delivered to
      customers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Delivery of Digital Services</h2>
    <p>
      - All digital services, such as premium subscriptions or credits, are
      delivered instantly once a successful payment is confirmed.<br />
      - Customers will have immediate access to purchased features through their
      registered Amoura account.<br />
      - In rare cases, delivery may take up to 24 hours due to technical delays
      or verification checks.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Geographical Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Amouraâ€™s services are available worldwide. Users can access purchased
      features from any supported region using the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Failure of Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      If you do not receive access to your purchased digital service within 24
      hours of payment, please contact our support team at
      <a href="mailto:hello@amoura.dev">hello@amoura.dev</a>. We will
      investigate and ensure prompt resolution.
    </p>
