          <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Refund Policy</h1>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This Refund Policy applies to all purchases made through the Amoura
            application, operated by Trupasion.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. No Refunds</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            All payments made for subscriptions, premium features, or any other
            paid services within Amoura are strictly
            <strong>non-refundable</strong>. Once a payment has been processed,
            no refunds will be issued, regardless of usage, cancellation, or
            dissatisfaction.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            2. Cancellation of Services
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Users may cancel their subscription or stop using paid services at
            any time. However, such cancellations will not result in a refund of
            any fees already paid. Access to premium features will continue
            until the end of the current billing cycle.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            3. Exceptional Circumstances
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In rare cases where a billing error occurs (for example, duplicate
            transactions), users may contact our support team at
            <a href="mailto:hello@amoura.dev" class="text-blue-600 underline"
              >hello@amoura.dev</a
            >. Such issues will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and
            corrective action may be taken at our sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Free Trials</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            If a free trial is provided, users may cancel before the trial ends
            to avoid being charged. Once the trial converts to a paid
            subscription, the above
            <strong>non-refundable policy</strong> applies.
          </p>
