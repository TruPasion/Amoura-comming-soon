        <p class="mb-4">
          This Refund Policy applies to all purchases and contributions made
          through the Amoura application, operated by Trupasion.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Current Beta Release</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Amoura is currently in its <strong>beta release</strong>. During this
          phase, all core features and services are offered
          <strong>free of charge</strong> to a limited number of customers. No
          subscription or payment is required until the stable version of the
          application is launched.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Donations</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Users may choose to make a voluntary <strong>donation</strong> if they
          find value in our services and wish to support the development of
          Amoura. All such contributions are considered goodwill payments and
          are <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Future Pricing</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Upon official stable release, Amoura may introduce subscription plans
          or paid premium features. At that stage, our
          <strong>non-refundable purchase policy</strong> will apply to all paid
          services. Access to free features will remain available where
          applicable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          4. Exceptional Circumstances
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In rare cases where a billing error occurs (e.g., duplicate
          transactions), users may contact our support team at
          <a href="mailto:hello@amoura.dev" class="text-blue-600 underline"
            >hello@amoura.dev</a
          >. Such issues will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and
          corrective action may be taken at our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Free Trials (Future)</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If free trials are introduced in the future, users may cancel before
          the trial ends to avoid being charged. Once converted to a paid
          subscription, the <strong>non-refundable policy</strong> will apply.
        </p>
